# PentestCyprus 3.0 | cl3ar_keys

**Category:** Forensics **Difficulty:** Easy

**Description:** We hijacked some traffic from an E-Corp employee logging in but although it is in clear text something is wrong because we cannot login.

## Solution
As the description says the file contains the login credentials of an E-Corp employee. By right clicking and following the tcp stream we can see the following credentials:

![Tcp Stream](https://github.com/Sikkis/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2017/pentestcyprus3.0/Forensics/cl3ar_keys/images/tcp-stream.png)

When you try to connect to the remote server with username `angel@` and password `p4l254...!@453.345` we can see that the credentials are invalid.

The ASCII representation of the TCP stream is not accurate because Wireshark all non-printable characters are being replaced by dots. By changing the data output to be presented as hex-dump, each dot between the letters of the password has the value of 0x7F. 

![Tcp Stream](https://github.com/Sikkis/ctf-writeups/blob/master/2017/pentestcyprus3.0/Forensics/cl3ar_keys/images/tcp-stream-hex.png)

In the ASCII table 0x7F is a non readable character call DEL. So for each one of the dots inside the password we have to delete one of the previous characters! The original password was:`p4l254...!@453.345`. Removing all the dots and the additional characters we get:`p4l!@45345`.
